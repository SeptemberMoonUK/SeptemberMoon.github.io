          <h1>Our story</h1>

          <p>
            September Moon was born from a simple love of fashion — and the joy of dressing my little girl.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like so many parents, I found myself drawn to beautiful children’s clothing, but increasingly
            disappointed by what I saw in mainstream stores. Contemporary fashion often seemed to rush
            children out of childhood, styling them to look older far too soon. I couldn’t help but reminisce
            about a time when children dressed like children — soft silhouettes, thoughtful details, and an
            unmistakable sweetness that felt timeless.
          </p>

          <p>
            That spark grew unexpectedly during a chance retail find. I came across a woman clearing out her
            daughter’s wardrobe, filled with the most beautiful vintage pieces. Dresses from brands I had never
            heard of, each one crafted with care and character. Curious, I began to research — and before I knew
            it (and admittedly after spending far too much of my husband’s money), a fiery passion for vintage
            children’s clothing had taken hold.
          </p>

          <p>
            What began as admiration quickly became a collection. Over time, I sourced vintage fashions from
            near and far, even all the way from the USA, alongside carefully chosen contemporary pieces that
            still honoured childhood for what it should be — playful, innocent, and full of wonder.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a growing collection and a hope of improving my family’s home life, September Moon came to life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, September Moon brings together vintage and modern children’s fashion with a shared heart:
            to offer beautiful clothing that allows little girls to simply be little girls. Each piece is chosen
            so that families can enjoy a small slice of the good years — those fleeting, magical moments when
            childhood feels endless and dressing up is pure joy.
